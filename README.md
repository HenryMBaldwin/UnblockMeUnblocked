A small tool to solve unblock me levels.

Written in python.

TODO:

-Finish interface between main program and ML model based solver
-Create a solution mode where you can step through a given solution
-possible creat a play mode where you can actually play the levels on the board rather than just edit them. This was not the purpose of this tool so may not be worthwhile.
